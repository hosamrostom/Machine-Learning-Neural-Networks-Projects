# Machine Learning (ML) & Neural Networks (NN) Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Networks (NN), developed using real-world datasets. The goal is to build predictive and intelligent models that solve practical problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries
- Scikit-learn for classic ML algorithms (Regression, Classification, Clustering)
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- TensorFlow & Keras for designing and training deep neural networks

## üìÇ Project Highlights
- Supervised ML models using real datasets (e.g., sales, QA data, sensor data)
- Implementation of Neural Networks for structured data and image recognition
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE
- Feature engineering, cross-validation, and model tuning

## üîç Topics Covered
- Linear & Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- Deep Neural Networks (MLP, CNNs)  
- Model training, validation, and deployment techniques
